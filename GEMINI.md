# REAPER EEL Scripts

## Directory Overview

This directory contains a collection of EEL scripts for the REAPER digital audio workstation (DAW). EEL is a scripting language used within REAPER for creating custom actions, effects, and workflow enhancements.

## Key Files

*   `Remove redundant CCs.eel`: This script provides a user interface to remove duplicate or unnecessary MIDI Continuous Controller (CC) messages from a MIDI item in the REAPER editor. This is useful for cleaning up MIDI data and reducing file size.
*   `Smooth CCs.eel`: This script provides a user interface with a slider to smooth out the values of selected MIDI CC messages. This is useful for creating more natural-sounding automation curves.

## Usage

To use these scripts, you need to have REAPER installed. You can load these `.eel` files into the REAPER script editor and then run them as actions. They will typically open a new window with a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the script's functionality. The scripts are designed to be run from within the REAPER's MIDI editor.
